Broker is in the business of showcasing and promoting properties for investment or sale on the BulkCondoDeals.com marketplace (the “Marketplace”) or through direct marketing to potential buyers and investors. The undersigned parties and all related affiliates and associates, (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the “Buyer”) acknowledge their desire to receive from Broker any and all information pertaining to the Property and a potential  acquisition or investment opportunity therein (the “Confidential Information”). Broker, Buyer and other parties hereto are collectively referred to as the “Parties”.<br><br>

In consideration of good and valuable consideration and valuable information provided by Broker and Seller, Buyer agrees to the following:<br><br>




      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>1. KEEP INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL</strong>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Buyer acknowledges that any Confidential Information disclosed to others will be damaging to the Seller, Broker  and the Property. Buyer understands that Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the fact that the Property is for sale; financial details; identity of Seller; and any other disclosed information not generally known by the public. Buyer and Buyer’s broker or agent, to the extent they have a broker (the “Buyer’s Broker”), agree not to disclose Confidential Information to anyone other than his or her direct advisors and affiliates who have likewise agreed to be bound by the same confidentiality assumed hereunder by Buyer. Buyer agrees that all copies of materials and data provided, whether in electronic or printed format, shall be confidential and shall be returned to Broker in the event Buyer decides not to pursue an acquisition or investment in the Property.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. DIRECT ALL CONTACT THROUGH BROKER</strong>
      </p><br>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. USE INFORMATION FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY</strong>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Buyer agrees to use the Confidential Information solely to evaluate the Property for purchase and for investment and not for any other purposes whatsoever.<br /><br />

If Buyer should circumvent the Broker and effect such a purchase, lease or investment directly or indirectly with the Seller within two (2) years after the date of signing the Agreement, the Buyer shall immediately become liable for the full commission specified by the Broker. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY SELLER</strong>
      </p><br>
      <p>

Buyer understands that purchasing or investing in the Property represents investment risks and that Buyer should obtain professional assistance from independent accounting, legal and financial advisors to verify said information prior to consummating an agreement to purchase or invest in any Property.  Buyer will not rely solely on the unverified information provided by Broker. Seller is the source of all representations made about the Property. Broker cannot verify the accuracy of said information and makes no warranty or guarantee, express or implied, as to the accuracy of such information. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL ABILITY</strong>
      </p><br>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. ENFORCEMENT</strong>
      </p><br>
      <p>

Buyer and Buyer’s Broker each acknowledge and agree that any breach of their obligations hereunder will cause Seller, Broker and Property irreparable harm for which Seller, Broker and Property have no adequate remedy at law, and that Seller, Broker and Property shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent a breach or continued breach of this Agreement, in addition, to any other remedies Seller, Broker and Property may have at law or in equity, and that this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable in accordance with its terms. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8. AGENCY DISCLOSURE</strong>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Broker is either a broker for the Seller of the Property or a Transactional Broker representing buyers that contact them through the Marketplace or otherwise in connection with the Property.<br /><br />

All fees shall be paid to Broker by Seller or Seller’s listing broker (the “Seller’s Broker”) upon the sale, trade, lease or transfer of Seller’s Property.<br /><br />
